Just a quick note about changes in 08/28/21. v 1.2.6

* npz files now use compression, so they will be smaller

* doodler by default now uses threading, so it should be faster
> You can disable this by editing the environment/settings.py and setting THREADING to False

* new variable 'orig_image' written to npz, as well as 'image'
> they are identical except for occasions where converting imagery to floats creates a 4th band, to accommodate a nodata band in the input. so 'orig image ' and 'image' would have different uses for segmentation and are therefore both preserved. orig_image is now the one written to npz files for zoo

* new function  `gen_images_and_labels_4_zoo.py`, which creates greyscale jpegs and 3-band color images (orig images) and writes them to the results folder
* updated the other utility functions to accommodate the new variable `orig_images`, which now takes priority over the variable `images`
* website and README updated with details about all of the utility scripts
