Get a behind the scenes look into the team working with Doodler, the workflow, communication and much more! 
<!--truncate-->
## The Story Behind Doodler
<p>
My motivation is show the workflow and communications for the team that used Doodler to ensure transparency in the scientific machine learning community.
Give a summary of what is about to be discussed
Mention that sources will be linked at the bottom
</p>

## The Team

### Backgrounds of Team Members
- Student Contractors
- researchers at USGS
- 

## Annotating with Doodler

### The Training
- when training started
 The training was given in June of 2021 using a videochat and videosharing platform to an audience of student contractors and researchers. The training was lead by the lead developer and inventor of Doodler, Dan Buscombe, who shared a live feed of him utilizing Doodler.
- what was the content
- mention that it was an older version of Doodler
- Ask dan if I can reference him here

### The Workflow
- Ask Jaycee if she wants to add her experience here
- How it was used
- bugs with 
- given pre-determined classes that were derived from expert panel 

### Common Challenges to Doodling
- data quality
-- mention how different images from the same location looked from each other depending on the quality of the image
-- @TODO find a good example of this and ask Dan if I can use an image even if it is not from any of the published datasets
- adapting to different image types
- adapting to labeling a variety of images from differnet locations



### Communication and Resolving Conflicts
2. What meetings were like
3. How interactions occurred
- Highlight that during conflict resolution that retaining consistency was valuable
 - show example image here

### Doodler's Evolution and its Impact on workflow
- Doodler performance issues
- Doodler gaining tools over time
- modification to how Doodler segmented imagery 
    cite the example where doodler no longer "remember past Doodles" due it causing errors



#### Good Phrases
"discriminate landforms and land uses in landscape imagery" - Dan's 2018 research paper
