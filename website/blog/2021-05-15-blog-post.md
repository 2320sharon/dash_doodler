### Purpose
This is a simple utility that allows you to visualize the contents of npz files

### Usage

From the main Doodler folder ...

```
cd utils
```

The syntax is this:

```
python viz_npz.py [-t {0}/1/2/3 ]
```

### Arguments
`-t` (input npz file type)`
* 0: (default) normal Doodler output file
* 1: `labelgen`
* 2: `npz_zoo`


### Use case: I want to print doodles and labels from of each npz file from a Doodler session

```
python viz_npz.py
```

which is equivalent to

```
python viz_npz.py -t 0
```

### Use case: I want to print doodles and the RF and CRF labels from of each npz file created by running `plot_label_generation`

```
python viz_npz.py -t 1
```

### Use case: I want to print doodles and the RF and CRF labels from of each npz file created by running `gen_npz4zoo` (i.e. the inputs to segmentation Zoo)

```
python viz_npz.py -t 2
```
