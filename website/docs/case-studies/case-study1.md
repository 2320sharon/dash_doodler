# Case Study 1: Greyscale geophysical imagery

This is raw sidescan imagery collected using a Humminbird, in the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. The data was collected and processed using methods detailed in  [Buscombe et al. (2015)](../tutorial-extras/references) and  [Buscombe (2017)](../tutorial-extras/references). The top of each image is the water column, then continuing from top to bottom, the river bed, and finally the riverbank 'shadow' (an acoustic shadow). On the riverbed itself, coarse and fine textures are apparent that correspond to relatively coarse and fine sediment or sedimentary bedforms. Wood is also sometimes visible.

The 4 classes we can consistently identify are: water, rough, smooth, wood, and shadow.
